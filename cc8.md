## Recap Cost Estimation for Join

### Nested Loop Join

One possible approach is to use nested loop 

1. for each tuple $t$ in $R$
    1. for each tuple $u$ in $S$
        1. if $t$ and $u$ satisfy $c$, output $t$ and $u$.

The cost of this approach is $B(R) + |R| \cdot B(S)$. The $B(R)$ is total cost of loading all tuples from $R$ once. For each tuple of $R$, it will be compared with every tuple in $S$, hence $|R| \cdot B(S)$.

If we flip the outter/inner relation roles of $R$ and $S$, we get the following cost $B(S) + |S| \cdot B(R)$.


### Block Nested Loop Join

Assuming the buffer pool is of size $m$, we divde the buffer pool into $m-2$ frames for loading $R$ and 1 frame for loading $S$ and 1 frame for output
1. for each $m-2$ pages in $R$, we extract each tuple $t$
    1. for each tuple $u$ in $S$
        1. if $t$ and $u$ satisfy $c$, output $t$ and $u$.

The cost of this approach is $B(R) + \lceil B(R) / (m - 2) \rceil \cdot B(S)$.
The cost will be $B(S) + \lceil B(S) / (m - 2) \rceil \cdot B(R)$ if the outer/inner relations are swapped.

### Index Nested Loop Join

If the join predicate $c$ is $R.a = S.b$ and an index attribute exists for $S.b$, we can optimize the nested loop join by using the indexed relation as the inner relation. 

1. for each tuple $t$ in $R$
    1. find the tuple $u$ in $S$ with $u.b = t.c$ using index 
        1. output $t$ and $u$.


The cost of this approach is $B(R) + |R| \cdot K$ where $K$ is a constant dependent on the structure of the index or the height of the B+ Tree index. E.g. if the height of the B+ Tree is 3, then $K = 4$ assuming each node occupying a page. 

An exterem case where $R$ is sorted by $a$ and $S.b$ is a clustered index. The total cost is $B(R) + B(S)$. 


### Sort Merge Join

The fourth alternative is to sort merge join. 

1. Sort $R$ by the attribute used in $c$
2. Sort $S$ by the attribute used in $c$
3. Merge the sorted $R$ and sorted $S$ like external sort

The cost of step 1 is 
$$2\cdot B(R) \cdot (1 + \lceil log_{m-1}(\lceil B(R) / m \rceil)\rceil)$$

The cost of step 2 is 
$$2\cdot B(S) \cdot (1 + \lceil log_{m-1}(\lceil B(S) / m \rceil)\rceil)$$

The cost of step 3 is 
$$B(R) +  B(S)$$


### Hash Join

The fourth altenrative is to make use of a in memory hash table.

Assuming we hash the join attribute used in $c$ of $S$ and stored it in a hash table, and the hash table is fitting in the RAM, (one big assumption), we can compute join by

1. for each tuple $u$ in $S$
    1. add $u$ (projected attributes) to HT
2. for each tupel $t$ in $R$
    1. lookup $t$'s attribute in HT
        1. output $t$ and the value in HT

The cost of this approach is $B(R) +B(S)$ because we scan both tables exactly once.


## Recap Equivalence rules

Let $R$, $R'$ and $R''$ be relations, the subset of requivalence rules is as follows,

1. $\sigma_{c_1}(\sigma_{c_2}(R)) \equiv \sigma_{c_1 \wedge c_2}(R)$ 
2. $\sigma_{c_1}(\sigma_{c_2}(R)) \equiv \sigma_{c_2}(\sigma_{c_1}(R))$
3. $\Pi_{a_1}(\Pi_{a_2} ... (\Pi_{a_n}(R))) = \Pi_{a_1}(R)$ if $a_1 \subseteq a_2 \subseteq ... \subseteq a_n$
4. $\sigma_{c}(R \times R') \equiv R \bowtie_{c} R'$.
5. $R \bowtie_{c} R' \equiv  R' \bowtie_{c} R$.
6. $R \bowtie_{c_1} (R' \bowtie_{c_2} R'') \equiv (R \bowtie_{c_1} R') \bowtie_{c_2} R''$
7. $\sigma_{c}(R) \equiv R$ if $c \not \subseteq attr(R)$
8. $\sigma_{c_1}(R\bowtie_{c_2} R') \equiv \sigma_{c_1}(R) \bowtie_{c_2} \sigma_{c_1}(R')$
9. $R \cap R' \equiv R' \cap R$
10. $R \cup R' \equiv R \cup R$
11. $R \cap (R' \cap R'') \equiv (R \cap R') \cap R''$
12. $R \cup (R' \cup R'') \equiv (R \cup R') \cup R''$
13. $\Pi_{a_1 \cup a_2} (R \bowtie_{c} R') \equiv \Pi_{a_1}(R) \bowtie_{c} \Pi_{a_2}(R')$  if $attr(c) \equiv a_1 \cup a_2$.
14. $\Pi_{a_1 \cup a_2} (R \bowtie_{c} R') \equiv \Pi_{a_1 \cup a_2}(\Pi_{a_1\cup a_3}(R) \bowtie_{c} \Pi_{a_2\cup a_4}(R') )$ if $a_3 \cup a_4 \equiv attr(c)$
15. $\Pi_{a}(R \cup R') \equiv \Pi_{a}(R) \cup \Pi_{a}(R')$
16. $\Pi_{a}(\sigma_{c}(R)) \equiv \sigma_{c}(\Pi_{a}(R))$ if $attr(c) \subseteq a$
17. $\sigma_{c}(R - R') \equiv \sigma_{c}(R) - \sigma_{c}(R') \equiv \sigma_{c}(R) - R'$
18. $\sigma_{c}(R \cap R') \equiv \sigma_{c}(R) \cap \sigma_{c}(R')$
19. $\sigma_{c}(R \cup R') \equiv \sigma_{c}(R) \cup \sigma_{c}(R')$


## Recap Cost Estimation

In DBMS, the sizes of the relations are recorded periodically in the catalog. The catalog sub-system keeps track of the following the statistics which can be used to approximate the selectivity.
1. $N(R)$ the number of tuples in $R$
2. $V(a,R)$ the number of unique values of attribute $a$ in $R$.
3. $min(a,R)$ the minumum value of attribute $a$ in $R$
4. $max(a,R)$ the maximum value of attribtue $a$ in $R$.

### Cardinality Estimation

Given the above catalog statistics, we can estimate the selectivity ratio, $\alpha(c, R)$.

#### Equality Predicate

In case $c$ is $a = v$ where $a$ is an attribute of $R$ and $v$ is a value, $\alpha(a = v, R) = 1 / V(a,R)$.

#### Range Equality Predicate

In case $c$ is $a > v$ where $a$ is an attribute of $R$ and $v$ is a value, $\alpha(a > v, R) = (max(a,R) - v) / (max(a,R) - min(a,R) + 1)$ assuming values of $a$ in $R$ follow a uniform distribution.

In case the distribution is not uniform, we may use a histogram with binning to obtain a better estimation. However building historgram for a large table could be expenive. In case of large data set, DBMS often collect a small sample to build the histogram.

#### Conjunction Predicate

In case $c$ is $c_1 \wedge c_2$, assuming values constrained by $c_1$ are independent of those constrained by $c_2$, $\alpha(c_1 \wedge c_2, R) = \alpha(c_1, R) \cdot \alpha(c_2, R)$. 




## Exercise 1 

Consider relation $People(salary, name, department)$, and the following relational algebra expression:​

$$
\Pi_{name}(\sigma_{salary >100}(\Pi_{name,salary}(People)))
$$


1. $\Pi_{name}(\sigma_{salary>100}(People))$
1. $\Pi_{name}(\sigma_{salary>100}(\Pi_{salary}(People)))$
1. $\sigma_{salary>100}(\Pi_{name,salary}(People))$
1. $\sigma_{salary>100}(\Pi_{name}(\Pi_{name,salary}(People)))$
1. $\Pi_{name}(\sigma_{salary>100}(\Pi_{name}(\Pi_{salary}(People))))$


## Exercise 2


Consider two relation $X(A,B)$ and $Y(B,C)$ with the following statistics:​

* $|X| = 200, V(A,X) = 100, V(B,X) = 20$​

* $|Y| = 1000, V(B,Y) = 10, V(C,Y) = 1000$​

* $min(A,X) = 0, max(A,X)= 100$

Assuming all values of $B$ that appear in $Y$ also appear in $X$.

1. estimate the number of tuples $\sigma_{A=10}(X)$
2. estimate the number of tuples $X \bowtie Y$
3. estimate $V(A, X \bowtie Y)$​


## Exercise 3


Consider the following relations:​

* $Sailors(\underline{sid}, sname, rating, age)​$
* $Reserves(\underline{sid, bid, day})​$
* Reserves:​
    * Each tuple is 40 bytes long, 100 tuples per page, 1000 pages.
    * ​There are 100 boats (each equally likely)​
* Sailors:​
    * Each tuple is 50 bytes long, 80 tuples per page, 500 pages.
    * Assume there are 10 different ratings (1..10, each equally likely)​
* Buffer size = 5​
